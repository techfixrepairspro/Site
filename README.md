# TechFix Pro Website Setup

## Contact Form Setup

Your website is now configured to send form submissions to: **techfixrepairspro@gmail.com**

The contact form uses FormSubmit, a free service that handles form submissions for static websites with NO setup required!

### How it works:

1. **First Submission (One-Time Activation):**
   - The first time someone submits the form, FormSubmit will send a confirmation email to techfixrepairspro@gmail.com
   - Open that email and click the confirmation link
   - This is a one-time security measure to prevent spam

2. **After Confirmation:**
   - All form submissions will automatically be sent to techfixrepairspro@gmail.com
   - You'll receive an email for each submission with all the details
   - Completely free with unlimited submissions
   - No account creation needed!

### What you'll receive in each email:

- Customer's name
- Customer's email address
- Phone number (if provided)
- Selected service
- Their message/issue description

## Files Included

- **index.html** - Main website file
- **styles.css** - All styling and design
- **script.js** - Interactive features and animations

## How to Use

1. Download all three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js)
2. Keep them in the same folder
3. Double-click index.html to open in your browser
4. To publish online, upload all three files to your web hosting service
